### Dori's hangman

Fairly basic version of hangman, with some QoL stuff that would happen in a non-digital version such as not being able to input same letter twice.


### How-to
Basically, put your name in, click on get quote, and start playing. For the sake of ease, I've left the actual quote below, so you can more easily get to the score submission.

### What else?
I haven't made the more complicated scoring system due to time constraints, however I did make a sorting thing that basically does the sorting in order of priority as required.
